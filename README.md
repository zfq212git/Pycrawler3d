# Pycrawler3d
To write a crawler with python used to get 3d data related news/updates/articles on internet

Requirements:
1. can pull down 3D data related news/articles from website like leiphone.com, and save them into Evernote or Onedrive

Plan
1. to write a program that can run from local with hard coded targets
2. to make different inputs possible...
3. to rewrite it as a service, and deploy onto like AWS
4. to make it distrubted so that can crawl more sites
5. to make the crawler more intelligent to avoid pulling down too many unrelated stuff or stuff I am not interested in
